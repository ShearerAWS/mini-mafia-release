# Install
## Android
[Mini Mafia is on the Google Play Store!](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.AlexShearer.MiniMafia) You can download the app from the Store, or install the .apk directly.
## iOS
Unity is deprecating their network functionality and is not planning on support for IPv6 only networks. Because of this, I am unable to publish the app on the Apple App Store. To install Mini Mafia on iOS you will have to download the iOS release files and open them in XCode.

# About
Mini Mafia is a deception-based party game designed for 5-10 players similar to Mafia or Werewolf. But unlike regular mafia, no player is eliminated during the game. In order to stop the mafia, officers must work together to complete important tasks for the investigation. Hidden among the group are members of the mafia, who will try to sabotage these tasks. As a police officer, you will need to figure out who you can actually trust. As a mafia member, you will have to keep your identity secret while deceiving your friends. 

In order to play, each player needs their own device connected to the same WiFi network or mobile hotspot. Games can be played across multiple different devices.
